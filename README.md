# GoSenseiBot

*GoSenseiBot* is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot that allows you to play the very
popular game *GO* in a Telegram chat with you friends!

*GoSenseiBot* will accept commands such as "/place a4" and send
you a visualization of the game board after every move.

(Heads up: sadly, I cannot guarantee that the server will be running continuously...)
